# Agent Instructions

## Evidence-Required Changes
- `patterns.toml` may only be edited after reviewing official library documentation and confirming the change is defensible. Provide evidence before making any edits.
- Fixtures may only be edited after obtaining irrefutable evidence that the fixture itself is wrong. Provide that evidence before editing.

## Pre-Commit Quality
- Resolve all `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` issues before committing.
